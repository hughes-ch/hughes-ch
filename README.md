Hi, I'm Chris Hughes, a freelance web developer specializing in Python. 

I started my career with Raytheon Technologies after graduating Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Engineering. 

I spent five years at Raytheon, and was fortunate enough for some awesome experiences travelling, developing, integrating, and learning. My primary languages were C++, Perl, and MATLAB, though I troubleshot several more (including a proprietary language - Yikes!). Due to the incredible scale of the systems, I learned how to integrate massive, multi-process systems, and I look forward to applying those skills in my career going forward. 

Now that I'm out of the defense and aerospace industry, I can focus on cutting edge technologies. Though I'm new and self taught, I'm constantly adding to my Python, Flask, and Django knowledge. I intend to contribute as a backend developer to build fast, scalable web apps.
